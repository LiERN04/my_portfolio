# Documents Folder

Place your resume PDF file here with the name `resume.pdf`.

Your resume file should be:

- Named exactly `resume.pdf` (lowercase)
- A valid PDF file
- Contains your actual resume content

The current implementation will download this file when users click the "Resume" button in your portfolio.
